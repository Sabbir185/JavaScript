const firstName = 'Sabbir';
const lastName = 'Ahmmed';
// const fullName = firstName+ " "+lastName+" is my name";

const fullName = `${firstName} ${lastName} is my name`

console.log(fullName);


// another awesome feature without \n & using Acute symbol
const mySelf = `hi , my name is Sabbir Ahmmed.
My country is Bangladesh.
My village name Talsher. `

console.log(mySelf);
